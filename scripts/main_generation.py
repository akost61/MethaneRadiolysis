Generation-Tracking Script for Radiolysis Monte Carlo Simulations

This script tracks  events organized by electron generation (primary, secondary, 
tertiary, etc.) to analyze event patterns in radiolysis simulations.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run Monte Carlo simulations with generation tracking at specified incident energy
2. Organize event data by generation number (primary = 0 ; secondary = 1; tertiary = 2; etc.)
3. Calculate total events per generation
4. Export generation-resolved data to Excel

DATA STRUCTURE:

run_generation_simulations():
  - Returns event counts organized by generation rather than by trajectory
  - Each row represents a generation level (0=primary, 1=secondary, etc.)
  - Each column represents one of the 28 collision event types
  - Shape: [10 × 28 events]

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Excel workbook structure:
  - Single sheet: 'generation_data'
  - Rows: Generation levels (indexed 0, 1, 2, ...)
  - Columns: All 28 event types from event_names
  - Additional 'Total' column: Sum of all events in each generation
  - File naming: {energy_in_keV}keV_{num_sims}_simulations_results.xlsx

USE CASES:
- Analyze depth and branching in electron-induced radiolysis
- Identify dominant events at each generation


KEY DIFFERENCES FROM MAIN SIMULATION SCRIPT:
- No energy conservation validation (tracks event counts only)
- No species production analysis
- Data organized by generation instead of aggregated totals
- Single-sheet output instead of three-sheet workbook

Default configuration: 100 keV incident electrons, 10,000 simulations.

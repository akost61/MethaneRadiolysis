Main Execution Script for Radiolysis Monte Carlo Simulations

This script orchestrates the complete simulation workflow: running Monte Carlo simulation,
processing results, generating convergence diagnostics, and exporting data to Excel. 

This script also tracks events organized by electron generation (primary, secondary, 
tertiary, etc.) to analyze event patterns in radiolysis simulations.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run Monte Carlo simulations at specified incident energy
2. Generate convergence analysis plots
3. Process results into three data views: events, energy, and species
4. Perform energy conservation validation
5. Export results to Excel workbook

6. Run Monte Carlo simulation with generation tracking at specified incident energy
7. Organize event data by generation number primary = 0 ; secondary = 1; tertiary = 2; etc.)
8. Calculate total events per generation
9. Export generation-resolved data to Excel

DATA PROCESSING:

create_dataframes(data, electron_attachment_energy):
  - Converts raw simulation data into three analysis perspectives:
    * df_events: Event frequency counts for all 28 event channels
    * df_energy: Energy transfer per event type (Count × delta_k), except electron attachment is set to the total electron attachment energy
    * df_species: Species production counts aggregated across all reactions
 - Note - electron attachment is different from other events because it includes both changes in the potential energy of the molecules, but also the removal of the electron 
        and any excess kinetic energy from the simulation

run_generation_simulations():
  - Returns event counts organized by generation rather than by trajectory
  - Each row represents a generation level (0=primary, 1=secondary, etc.)
  - Each column represents one of the 28 collision event types
  - Shape: [10 × 28 events]


main():
  - Configurable parameters: incident_energy (eV), total_simulations
  - Runs simulation suite and generates diagnostic plots
  - Validates energy conservation: input energy = transferred energy + terminating energy (which is associated with each electron's remaining energy after it crosses the 1 eV threshold)
  - Exports three-sheet Excel workbook:
    * Event_data: Raw counts the 28 different events/channels
    * Energy_data: Energy distribution for each of 28 different events/channels
    * Species_data: Net species production with stoichiometry
  - File naming: {energy_in_keV}keV_{num_sims}_simulations_results.xlsx

  - Creates single-sheet output: {energy_in_keV}keV_{total_simulations}_generational_results.xlsx
  - Rows: Generation levels (indexed 0, 1, 2, ...)
  - Columns: All 28 event types from event_names
  - Additional 'Total' column: Sum of all events in each generation

ENERGY CONSERVATION CHECK:
Total input = incident_energy × total_simulations
Total output = Σ(event_count × delta_k) + terminating_energy + attachment_energy
These should match within numerical precision.

Default configuration: 100 keV incident electrons, 10,000  simulations.
